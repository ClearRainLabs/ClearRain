- Szabo exploring Dawkin's idea about money

- money is a formal token of trust *between* human groups

- bring in intrinsic and extrinsic motivation
  - extrinsic motivation doesn't motivate people like economist think

- discuss Flow theory on intrinsic vs extrinsic motivation: they differentiate between pleasure and enjoyment
  - we've evolved to want to satisfy ourselves, not others
