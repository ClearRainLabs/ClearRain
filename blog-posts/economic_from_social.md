# Differentiating Trust in the Social and Economic Realms

- refer to Limitations of Aligned Incentives
  - differentiate between objective and subjective consensus (or lack thereof for the latter)
    - limiting possibility to align incentives regarding subjective measures

  - explored the difference between intrinsic and extrinsic motivation
    - even the effectiveness of aligning incentives is limited

  - we believe that technology should be built to work with human nature

- further differentiate between


    WHAT AM I ARGUING?



  - trust naturally exists in two different worlds: communities and markets
  - operate by completely different norms

Consider the thought experiment that Duke professor Dan Ariely poses in *Predictably Irrational*: You're at you in-laws for Thanksgiving. Your mother-in-law put in a lot of work to get everyone together and to make a delicious meal. You are not a free-loader and because you took an economics 101 class, you know that people are inherently selfish and that money is the best motivator. Naturally you thank your mother-in-law and ask her, "How much do I owe you? $300? No, I'll give you $400!" Everyone looks at you in shock. Why

- Ariely differentiates between social and market norms


- Szabo exploring Dawkin's idea about money

- money is a formal token of trust *between* human groups

  - money solves Szabo's triple-coincidence problem
    - two people must 1) want each other's goods 2) at the same time 3) in the same place for a trade to happen

- connect back to intrinsic and extrinsic motivation
  - extrinsic motivation doesn't motivate people like economist think

- discuss Flow theory on intrinsic vs extrinsic motivation: they differentiate between pleasure and enjoyment
  - pleasure comes from satisfying a cultural or biological norm
    - eating, having sex, making money
    - pleasure does not help long term happiness
  - enjoyment, which contributes to long term happiness

  - we've evolved to want to satisfy ourselves, not others
