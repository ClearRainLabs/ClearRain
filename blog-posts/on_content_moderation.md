# On Content Moderation

> "I am ashamed to think how easily we capitulate to badges and names, to large societies and dead institutions" -Ralph Waldo Emerson in *Self-Reliance*, 1841

Recently YouTube caused outrage in many tech circles when YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki [said](https://www.cnn.com/videos/business/2020/04/19/inside-youtubes-numerous-policy-changes-during-the-pandemic.cnn) it is against YouTube policy to disseminate views contradictory to the WHO.

  [https://twitter.com/Austen/status/1245689629178650624] - Austen Alfred points out, traditional authorities have spread much information regarding the disease including that there's no evidence of human-to-human transmission, there is no airborne transmission, and that masks are not effective.

  - traditional authorities have shown that at the very least, they are fallible like everyone else.

- unfortunately YouTube has taken the easy content-moderation route, censoring content that contradicts the traditional authorities.
  - typical for tech companies to use traditional authorities as infallible sources of truth.

  - this is an inside-out content moderation approach,  based on Chris Dixon's differentiation between [inside-out and outside-in tech adoption](https://cdixon.org/2020/01/17/inside-out-vs-outside-in)
  - inside-out information adoption: information is adopted from the traditional authorities
  - outside-in: information comes from outside the traditional authorities and is eventually accepted by them

- inside-out content moderation approach often chosen by
  - likely chosen because it is easy and efficient
  - nobody can be expected to verify every piece of information that they come across. Not only is this extremely inefficient, but it's actually [impossible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%BCnchhausen_trilemma) according to the skeptical school of philosophy.

- institutions able to abuse their power and suppress information that is not in their self-interest, potentially suppressing valuable information

- seemingly the only other alternative is to allow all information.

- as we'll explore, many of the biggest breakthroughs in research are by necessity outside-in.

- look at problems with the inside-out approach to content moderation and propose a potential solution for outside-in content moderation.

## Fallible Institutions

- YouTube decided to only allow the perspective of traditional institutions online, aligning themselves with the inside-out approach to
Problem with only seeing one perspective on issues:

Problem with the inside-out approach:

1. There is no perfect perspective. All perspectives have inconsistencies and lack information.
2. Information can conflict with the self-interest of institutions. Institutions can use their preexisting influence to further impose their power.

- it's human nature to ignore information not in our self-interest. It's a huge cognitive blindspot that everyone has.
  - people within institutions will often justify the institution

We can only speculate as to why these public health authorities ignored the research supporting masks and that wearing masks is commonplace among healthcare professionals exposed to viral diseases (**have dad check**). Eric Weinstein [believes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7rd04KzLcg) that the WHO, CDC, and surgeon general lied to the public because they failed to stock the equipment required by the medical literature. Worried there would not be enough masks for the healthcare professionals if the general public started buying them, they told the general public that they did not work. Of course this is only speculation, yet we know that these authorities are either not the experts they claim to be, or lying to the public in their self-interest. We don't like either scenario. Either scenario makes it tough to trust them, and important to see other perspectives on matters.

## Research Suppression

- research is important because it can lead to huge technological advances
  - math research lead to the Turing machine, physics research allowed for the transister, a Rand think-tank led to the internet, and an internal information management project at CERN led to the web.

- traditional academic institutions consist of insiders and outsiders. The insiders, those who largely agree with the consensus views of the field are often labelled as experts while the outsiders, regardless of the research supporting their views, are often dismissed. Unfortunately this means that mavericks can often be ignored by their fields. Consider [Ignaz Semmelweis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignaz_Semmelweis), the 19th century Hungarian physician who discovered that doctors could drastically reduce maternal deaths with antiseptics. The medical establishment was insulted at the suggestion that doctors need to wash their hands, and it wouldn't be until Louis Pasteur confirmed the germ theory of disease that Semmelweis' suggestions would become mainstream.

In another case, Nassim Taleb discusses in *The Black Swan* that much of the statistics and economic establishment are yet to accept the omnipresence of [power-laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_law) and [fractal geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal), instead often favoring ideas of normal distributions and economic equilibriums that often work better in theory than in practice. When Taleb published *The Black Swan* in 2007, it had been over 40 years since mathematician and pioneer in fractal geometry Benoît Mendelbroit shared his ideas on the prices of commodities and financial securities with the economic establishment. As far as we are aware, these fields have still changed little.

- those within institutions are biased toward the beliefs of the institution
  - they spent years learning about these beliefs and may have gone on to do research built on them.
  - to accept the issues with their beliefs may be to invalidate their previous work.
  - instead, all the "experts" from within the institutions can just disregard the critiques. They are the experts after all. If everyone disregards the critiques, their work is never invalidated.

  - academic institutions control what research is funded and published
    - academic establishment determines research grants based on applications
    - nobel prize winning biochemist Albert Szent-Györgyi laments that all great discoveries are often unexpected or the product of intuition, not a predefined project proposal.[^2]

    - one particular case, later found out that the private foundation who supported him asked other scientists for feedback on his proposal
      - feedback was split, foundation discovered that the leading scientists in their fields supported the proposal, while less esteemed researchers did not

  - as he was beginning his career he was advised to write a proposal and then forget about it. The proposal should be solely for the backer.
    - Albert essay: https://muse.jhu.edu/article/405296/pdf

  - Louis Pasteur also acknowledged the role of serendipity in his work, famously saying that chance favors the prepared.
    - worked hard without looking for anything in particular

  - many great scientists prefer bottom-up, tinkering approaches to research. Not top-down, pre-planned research supported by contemporary institutions


- academic establishment prevents working from being published with peer-review

 - favoring the ideas and academics who agree with the mainstream views of a field

 - the biggest discoveries go against mainstream thinking. They find the flaws commonplace in their fields that other's had not.

 - Szent-Györgyi: of his 4 major discoveries, 2 were immediately rejected by the leaders in his field.

 - but peer-review is able to stop research from being published just because another researcher did not like it
   - could have a conflict of interest if the research would hurt his own
   - review could have little to no substance. Because the review is not reviewed, it does not matter. The research does not pass peer-review and cannot enter the most esteemed research journals
   - growing body of research could support it, but that does not matter.


- [Eric Weinstein](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7rd04KzLcg) and [Stephan Wolfram](https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/finally-we-may-have-a-path-to-the-fundamental-theory-of-physics-and-its-beautiful/) are exploring a unified theory of physics outside the academic establishment.
- Benoît Mendelbroit for example was an IBM fellow. It was the private sector that largely allowed Mendelbroit to pursue his own interests, not the academic establishment.




- idea that the establishment thinkers isn't new; physicist Max Planck famously said that science advances one funeral at a time




    - top-down approach is supported inside institutions. It's often an inside-out approach to research

    - bottom-up approach is often outside-in, questioning the established beliefs of the field.

## A Better Way Forward

- ideally there should be room for both approaches, top-down approach is great for discoveries that have been predicted by previous research like [gravitational waves]()

- content moderation should leave room for multiple perspectives.
  - acknowledges that no perspective is perfect, and that every perspective has it's own self-interest


- we're not arguing that there should not be quality controls on how information is published. They should not be one single entity that can decide what the truth is. Instead, we believe there should be many.

- quality controls on information are often necessary.
- Imagine an academic journal that just let everyone publish in it. It probably would not contain great research.
  - everyone cannot be expected to verify every paper they read.
  - verifying is expensive, the vast majority of people reading the vast majority of research will not recreate the experiments or try to recover the papers conclusions from first principles

On the other extreme, a single academic journal would have much better quality research, but it would only contain a limited amount of research and there would be a lot of great research that wouldn't be published. We think that we are still much closer to the centralized end of the spectrum today.

- the solution is somewhere in the middle.
- allow people to see many quality-controlled perspectives.



- starts with allowing outsiders to organize online



- internet has allowed anyone to publish content, but hasn't easily allowed people to work together to publish content

- people naturally associate in groups and it is much easier just to accept the groups established beliefs than to find their flaws

- allow people to organize together => They benefit from each other's reach

  - traditionally been no online mechanism to allow people to organize. Publishing platforms are often either open to all like Twitter, YouTube and Reddit, or people can build custom solutions with access control like The New York Times, Hackernoon, or even Wikipedia.



Within a community you may have editors and administrators who control what content is published or just who is allowed to publish.

- Importantly, allow people to decided what perspectives they want to see. For us, it's essential that everyone has the ability to decide that for themselves like how Kant believes it is essential that everyone learns to think for themselves.


- goal to allow information sources to act like markets. Sources who fail to adapt to knew knowledge will eventually be left behind. Researchers will gravitate towards communities that publish quality content and reward their contributors fairly


- solves the problem of peer-review, that a single person's opinion can stop research from being published
- still problem of funding the community, and that they'll still be government supported authorities like the WHO, CDC, and surgeon general
  - if people can build communities others think are valuable, they'll be able to find ways to get funding




- if there's not an existing community that can publish someone's content, or they think they can make a better community than the existing one. To make this practical, it should be as easy as possible to set up a new community or to join a new one.
  - not realistic for someone to have to create a new research journal.
  - but realistic for someone to be able to click a few buttons to create a research community where they can publish research online and add other researchers to the community


It's time to build.
