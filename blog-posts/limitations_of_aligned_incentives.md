# The Limitations of Aligned Incentives

The hype around cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum lead to a surge of projects trying to put seemingly everything on a blockchain including social media. Projects like [Steem], [Props] and [Kin] all use blockchain to reward users, developers, or both of social systems. Discussing projects like these the often cited article [Protocols Not Platforms](Jack Dorsey [cited] it as a inspiration for Twitter's Blue Sky initiative) argues that

These projects market themselves as realigning incentives between users and content creators by rewarding creators for the quality of their content, not the attention it receives.
Resultantly these projects should in theory reward quality content rather than the sensationalist and provocative, attention-grabbing content that is often rewarded on advertising platforms like Facebook and YouTube.

For many, aligned incentives are the be-all and end-all of network design (including us in our original version of [Realigning Online Incentives], yet as we argue here, it is not that simple. First, these subjective rewards protocols are inherently flawed due to the impossibility of subjective consensus. As a result, they will have issues with collusion, which is impossible to detect and stop. Next we will look at how this problem relates to decentralized governance in general and finally we question whether economically aligned incentives would even lead to a healthy social ecosystem online.
Lastly consider how these projects may be simplified

Although we are critical here of projects in our space, we wish to do so with good intentions. We think it is important to move the conversation forward on decentralized social media so that we can ultimately create better online social systems. And while we criticize some of the projects mentioned here, we would like to note that there’s also a lot these projects did really well to become reputable networks. Ultimately we hope that we will grow large enough to be criticized in blog posts discussing social media.


The Lack of Subjective Consensus

Let’s first take a look at how the aforementioned subjective reward protocols attempt to reward quality content and apps on their networks.

Generally these projects distribute rewards at set intervals to the creators, developers, or both based on some metric. In the case of [Steemit] the blogging platform on the Steem blockchain, Steem tokens are minted and rewarded to content creators proportional to the votes on their posts. The Steem whitepaper calls this process ‘subjective Proof of Work’ referencing Bitcoin’s Proof of Work consensus mechanism. But unlike Bitcoin’s objective consensus mechanism, Steem’s fundamental flaw is that there is no subjective consensus.

The purpose of a consensus protocol is for distributed identities to agree on some sort of truth, and there are limitations of what different identities can agree upon. Consider three people sitting around a table with three pencils on it. Everyone can agree on a standard definition for a pencil and they’re are 3 objects on the table that satisfy that definition. Everybody agrees because the number of pencils is objective. Yet now Alice, Bob and Charlie want to figure out which one is the best pencil. Alice says it’s the first because it is the biggest so it will last the longest. Bob says it is the second because it has the best shade of yellow, and Charlie, who considers himself a contrarian, likes the third. They argue for hours and cannot agree on the truth. There is no consensus.

With that said, bitcoin’s consensus works because it is purely objective. The inputs of a transaction either have the same sum as the outputs or they do not. A block either only contains valid transactions or it does not. And a block is either on the longest chain or it is not. Resultantly, there are clear definitions of honest and malicious validators to the Bitcoin network. Just as importantly, Bitcoin’s miners are doing objective work for the network. Miners use their hash power to increase security. The more honest hash power validating the network, the harder it is to attack. Miners provide objective value to the network and they are rewarded proportionally to the value they provide.

The same is not true for subjective consensus. Everyone will have different definitions of what constitutes good and bad content and therefore it is impossible to differentiate between honest and malicious actions. More importantly, there is no consensus regarding what content and actions may increase the quality of social networks and which do not. With a lack of consensus regarding what is honest, and what is valuable work for the network, there is no way to detect or stop people from creating different accounts to vote on their own posts or from [paying] bots vote on them. The latter is [already happening] on Steem and we would be shocked if the former was not. The Steem whitepaper even acknowledges and tries to justify this flaw saying, “Eliminating ‘abuse’ is not possible and shouldn’t be the goal. Even those who are attempting to ‘abuse’ the system are still doing work.”

The Collusion Problem

Subjective reward protocols work in theory under the assumption that all individuals are acting independently and purely in their own self-interest. If everyone acts independent of each other, then everyone will vote on content that


The ability to pay bots to vote on content brings up a larger problem with subjective reward protocols: the problem of collusion. There is no way to stop people from working together in distributed systems. It happens on Bitcoin in the form of mining pools so that miners can get more steady returns, yet mining pools do not undermine Bitcoin consensus. In the case of social networks,
