# Slipping the Disc

- discussion Weinstein and Thiel had the the slow rate of innovation

- Weinstein's idea of the Distributed Idea Suppression Complex or DISC for short

- institutions have baked-in assumptions of growth that no longer exist
- *Thiel's theory?*
  - when does Thiel say that innovation stopped?

- *examples Weinstein gives*
  - professors once being lavishly compensated
    - no longer anti-establishments professors like Noam Chomsky


- Weinstein in particular gives examples of how his research was suppressed at Universities
  - was told that some of his discoveries were not possible, only to see others credited for the same discoveries years later



- we provide an alternate, related, potentially-drastically-oversimplified explanation for the tech stagnation
  - the S-curve of network growth

  - as United States was competing with the Soviet Union for world supremacy, the United States needed to enlist the help of everyone



- We're excited about the potential for the decentralized research organization
  - quality-controlled platforms owned by the researchers
  - outlet to publish their work and collaborate with others

  - idea is simple: if you are a researcher and there is an existing organization that will accept your work, you join that organization. If there isn't, you can create your own. You'll have to do more work to get exposure and grow the organization, but that's necessary because not all research deserves exposure.

  - still the problem of funding public goods
